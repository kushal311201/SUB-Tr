     - Commit with your message
     - Push to GitHub
     - Trigger Vercel deployment

2. **Error Handling**
   - If an error occurs during deployment:
     - The script will automatically roll back changes

     - Check Vercel deployment logs for details
     - Fix the issue and redeploy

3. **Quick Recovery**
   - If you notice an error after deployment:
     - Run `./rollback.sh` to revert to the last working version
     - Fix the issue locally
     - Test thoroughly
     - Deploy again with `./deploy.sh`

4. **Best Practices**
   - Make small, focused changes
   - Test thoroughly before deploying
